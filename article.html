    If you have writing skills and creative talent, it’s also possible to get paid to create online content. I don’t do this as much as I used to, but I am very aware of how viable this income stream is.<br> 

Freelance writing (freelancing) is becoming a popular career choice for those who wish to work from home or abroad or while travelling. <br> For some, the freedoms associated with a career in freelance writing could outweigh the actual take home pay. For others, freelance writing is a way to catapult themselves from the daily grind of the 9 to 5 world.<br> 

When you’re locked into making money online and you focus on freelance writing as your primary source of income, you can literally work from anywhere in the world. <br> Some professional freelance writers have taken this as an opportunity to use freelance writing as a method to fund their adventures. Others use freelance writing a way to stay at home and spend more time with their families.<br> 

I’ve paid out over Ush35m over the last 2 years to freelancers for creating content for my various clients’ businesses.<br>  You can make some serious money freelancing.<br>

So how do you start making money online with freelance writing?

First, do some research about freelancing and then start brushing up on your writing skills.<br>  The best advice I would recommend here is start a blog and write about something you think someone would be interested in reading.<br>  Through your blog you’ll learn what your users like more and concentrate on building and growing that audience. <br> Your blog will also help you on expanding your portfolio that you’ll leverage on finding freelancing gigs.<br>  You’ll be able to find Freelance writing gigs online once you have your blog rolling or they’ll be able to find you once you focus on a niche.<br> 

Now it’s time to actively search for freelance writing jobs.<br>  When I first started freelance writing, I used Problogger and Freelance Writing Jobs.<br>  These job boards list new jobs daily and are often good quality jobs.<br>  I avoided freelance marketplaces like Upwork because the jobs weren’t high quality and I actually never landed a gig there.<br>  Go to social media and start connecting or following other writers and businesses you want to write for.<br>  Guest posting is great to build your portfolio.<br>  It’s also a way to get your name out there.<br>  For every guest post, you write and is published you receive an author bio with links back to your writer website, portfolio, or social media profiles.<br> 

The best thing you can do as a new freelance writer is continue to learn.<br>  Whether it’s writing tips, business tips or pitching tips, hone your skills by learning from those who have done it before.<br>
